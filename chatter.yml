    And I said a mixture of the two. I''m not educated on socialism, but from what
    I understand many of the Nordic countries practice watered down versions of it,
    whereby certain crucial needs of society are owned by the public, and less crucial
    needs are owned by private individuals. I would argue that the social safety net,
    (free education and universal healthcare) is an example of crucial needs being
    owned by the public.  Especially give  that it is the public that decides the
    availability of medicine for the sick and books for the student, and not some
    random health insurance company or loan servicing agency. Not to mention, Iceland
    leads in labor unions, (I think it''s something 79% of laborers belong to a union)
    while the US is in pretty much last place among developed countries.


    It might not be pure "hammer and sickle" socialism, but then again there''s not
    a country on this earth that practices complete laissez faire capitalism either.',
  ">but from what I understand many of the Nordic countries practice watered down\
    \ versions of it\n\nYoure using the word socialism wrongly. Social democracy is\
    \ not socialism, I'm from a nordic country and we do not have any socialist policy.\
    \ \n\nSocialism is when the workers own their work place democraticaly, so if\
    \ you did not see workers owning the means the production you didnt see any socialist\
    \ society. What you saw was social democracy and has nothing to do with socialism.\n\

    \ social controls that dictate actual consequences for anyone who doesn't  play\
    \ by the rules. (They actually jailed their bankers after the financial crisis\
    \ and made moves to halt crony capitalism). Furthermore, social welfare is a central\
    \ focus and gives everyone a right to healthcare and higher education, which they\
    \ are able to pay for with taxes because the closest thing they have to a military\
    \ is pretty much solely devoted to search and rescue and disaster relief. Not\
    \ to mention Iceland is arguably the oldest democracy in the world, and probably\
    \ one of the only European nations not to get rich as a direct result of colonizing\

    \ I was having a hard time containing my anger because if someone tried to pull\

    \ It was just so much extra work and over analyzing everything in a superficial\

    \ this dark skin little boy he had his hoody taken from him because it covered\
    \ his uniform and if he wanted to get it back he'd have t do a one hour detention,\
    \ fuck that shit. So I was tryna help him cause e seemed disengaged I didn't want\

    \ kids who look like no one cares for him, like I straight up thought he was homeless\
